# PHP-CRUD-Using-AJAX-Bootstrap
A PHP CRUD app using AJAX and Bootstrap for managing user data (name, email, mobile, location) with no page reload. AJAX handles async requests for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. Bootstrap ensures a responsive UI. Each action is handled in separate PHP files, and `db.php` manages the database connection.
